    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>Stray animals and their dependence on humans didn’t just come about through natural evolution, they are the result of two factors – Urbanization and Domestication. Due to unplanned, excessive construction and encroachment, the natural habitat of animals has been destroyed. With little to no naturally available sources of food or shelter, dogs resort to wandering, scavenging whatever they can find edible.

        When humans care for and domesticate animals, they become responsible for regulating the animal’s reproduction. Failure to meet this need has several consequences, the most severe of it being the growing, unsupervised population of stray dogs roaming in urban and rural areas.
        
        Another more terrible cause is abandonment of pet dogs. Dogs that have been mistreated by their owners and left to fend for themselves come under severe emotional stress. And while our first instinct is to contact the nearest animal shelter or NGO, it may not provide a permanent solution to the rising population of pet dogs who are becoming homeless and stray dogs who cannot survive on the streets due to disability or illness.</p>
